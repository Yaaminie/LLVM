# LLVM

## Introduction

LLVM stands for low level virtual machine. LLVM is a compiler and a toolkit for building compilers. LLVM project is the collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. LLVM isn’t a compiler for any given language, LLVM is a framework to generate object code from any source code.<br>
LLVM is designed around a language-independent intermediate representation (IR). Intermediate representation (IR), a low-level programming language similar to assembly. IR is a strongly typed reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set which abstracts away most details of the target.

## Working of LLVM

clang->opt(optimization)->llc->lld(object code)

On the front end, the LLVM compiler infrastructure uses clang — a compiler for programming languages C, C++ and Objective-C — to turn source code into an interim format. Then the LLVM clang code generator on the back end turns the interim format into final machine code.
Backend code of LLVM converts the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) to code for a specified machine or other languages.
The backend of LLVM features a target-independent code generator <br>

Optimization — Cleans the code for better run-time performance and addresses memory-related issues. <br>
The llc command compiles LLVM source inputs into assembly language for a specified architecture.  <br> 

Linker <br>
The lld subproject is an attempt to develop a built-in, platform-independent linker for LLVM. <br>

## C++11/C++14 features used
* Use of unique_ptr <br>
  std::unique_ptr: The destructors of this class release memory for the underlying object when the pointer goes out of scope. Through move semantics, it is ensured that only one   pointer can bind to the object at a time. <br>
* In C++11, auto_ptr has been deprecated and the following smart pointers added.
* Even nullptr is new feature add in version c++11
  nullptr keyword in place of NULL <br>
* Use of range based for loops and auto keyword 
* use of templates 
* use of auto keyword instead of any particular data type. 
* use of static_assert to test assertions at compile-time 
* use of =default and =delete 
* use of constexpr 
* use of Variadic template 
* use of move
* Use of scoped enums
* use of override ensures virtual function declared in a derived class has the same function signature as that of the base class.<br>
* NSDMI - Non-static data member initialisation inside struct <br> 
  Any non-static member of the class or a struct is initialized directly in its declaration, and not via a constructor. <br>
  
## Class hierarchy
* One of the core header files in LLVM is Type.h header file inside IR directory and subclasses are in DerivedTyes.h <br>
  6 subclasses inherits from same base class Type so it is Hierarchical Inheritance <br>
  Type.h: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/Type.h <br>
  DerivedTyes.h: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/DerivedTypes.h <br>
  Superclass: Type <br> 
  Subclasses: All the subclasses inherit only from class Type so Hierarchical Inheritance <br>
    - IntegerType  (Single Inheritance)
    - FunctionType (Single Inheritance)
    - StructType   (Single Inheritance)
    - ArrayType    (Single Inheritance)
    - VectorType   (Single Inheritance)
        - FixedVectorType derived from VectorType (so VectorType is Superclass/Base class and FixedVectorType is Derived/subclass of VectorType). Multilevel Inheritance.
        - ScalableVectorType is also a subclass of VectorType. Multilevel Inheritance.
    - PointerType  (Single Inheritance)
      
 * Single Inheritance <br>
   SringRef.h: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/StringRef.h  <br>
   Superclass: StringRef <br>
   Subclass: StringLiteral <br>
 
 * Single Inheritance <br>
   Value.h: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/Value.h   <br>
   Argument.h: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/Argument.h   <br>
   Superclass: Value <br>
   Subclass: Argument <br>
   
 * Single Inheritance  (include\llvm\IR\User.h)  <br>
   Value.h: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/Value.h   <br>
   User.h: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/User.h     <br>
   Superclass: Value <br>
   Subclass: User <br>  
   
 * Multilevel, Single and Multiple Inheritance <br>
   SmallVector.h: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/SmallVector.h  <br>
   Superclass: SmallVectorBase    <br>
   Subclass: SmallVectorTemplateCommon (Single inheritance) <br>
        Multilevel Inheritence 
      - SmallVectorTemplateBase (Superclass: SmallVectorTemplateCommon)
          - SmallVectorImpl (Superclass: SmallVectorTemplateBase)
                      
    Multiple Inheritance  <br>
    Superclasses: SmallVectorImpl and SmallVectorStorage(structure) <br>
    Subclass: SmallVector   <br>


## OOP design decisions for LLVM
* Inheritance 
  Use of Multiple, Single, Hierarchical and Multilevel Inheritance (examples described in Class Hierarchy section).
* Some member functions/data members are private, some are public and some are protected so this provides data abstraction and encapsulation.
* Concept of polymorphism is also used. 
* Virtual functions (Example: used in https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/Target/TargetMachine.h) and pure virtual functions (Example: used in https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/IR/PassManagerInternal.h) used for achieving polymorphism.  
* use of override keyword: Overriding means redefining a function which is present in the base class in the derived class. So the function signatures are the same but the         behavior will be different.
* Overloading is also used (Example: overloading of operator+ in https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/Twine.h)


## Design Patterns
* Language independence<br>
* Lot of optimization: Multiple-stages of analysis & transformations (optimization is possible with the help of IR)
* Modularity (Code divided into many source code files, header files and different folders)
* Use of inline keyword /inline functions <br>
* Use of templates
* Use of Object Oriented Concepts
* Use of iterators 
* Use of containers like map,vector,etc.
* Use of enums and unions.
* Use of classes that only define interface of member functions and definition is provided in another class
* concept of friend class: A friend class is a class that can access the private and protected members of a class in which it is declared as friend. 


## Usage of iterators and their own data structures

#### Iterators used
* iterator
* const_iterator and const_reverse_iterator. (SmallVector.h) <br> 
* rbegin(),rend(), begin(), end() and size()   (SmallVector.h) <br>
* input_iterator_tag and iterator_traits (SmallVector.h) <br>
* move_iterator (SmallVector.h) <br>
* Use of operator== and operator!= (Value.h)
* Use of reverse_iterator (Type.h)
* Iterators to iterate through the array(ADT- ArrayRef) containing pointers of a particular class.
* forward_iterator_tag (Value.h)

#### Abstract data structures used

* class APInt (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/APInt.h): allows large integer value types such as 3-bits, 15-bits, or more than 64-bits of    precision.
* class ArrayRef (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/ArrayRef.h): for representing a constant reference to an array's start pointer and it's    length.
* class StringRef (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/StringRef.h): for representing a constant reference to a string, i.e. a character array and a length, which need not be null terminated.
* class Twine(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/Twine.h): For concatenating temporary values as strings (uses binary tree)
* class EnumeratedArray(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/EnumeratedArray.h): defines an array type that can be indexed using scoped enum values. Scoped enums are strongly typed enumerations and enumerators must be accessed through the scope resolution operator ("::").
* class SmallVector (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/SmallVector.h): small vectors and used when the array is small or less number of elements have to stored
* class SmallString (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/SmallString.h): small strings, similar to SmallVector.
